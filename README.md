#HistologicalSlideGrading
 
Sample of scripts and data created for UROP research project

The goal of the research project was to automate the grading of histological slides based on mitosis.
Original data was provided by the TUPAC16 (Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge): http://tupac.tue-image.nl
A very small sample of the processed training and evaluation slides are included here for reference.

Slides were graded using a convolutional neural network (Tensorflow)
